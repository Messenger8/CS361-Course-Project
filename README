Download task_manager.py and run with python task_manager.py

Communication Contract:
Make sure python and ingredient_doubler.py are installed properly.
Request Data:
1. Run ingredient_doubler.py locally / in a terminal.
2. Write integer data to input_data.txt with each integer being a new line, example below:

  # example code
  def write_list_to_file(file_path, data_list):
    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        for item in data_list:
            file.write(f"{item}\n")

3.The microservice then will read that info and process it replacing the content with all numbers doubled.

Receive Data:
1. Simply read each line back into a list to recieve the data, example below:

# example code
def read_processed_data(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        return [float(line.strip()) for line in file.readlines()]
